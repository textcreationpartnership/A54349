         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YEſterday Morning arriv'd a <hi>Flanders Male,</hi> which brought no Freſher Letters than the 11th. from <hi>Vienna,</hi> there ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been that Morning an Extraordinary Courier arriv'd from the <hi>Imperial</hi> Camp, with Advice that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was March'd from <hi>Mohaez</hi> towards <hi>Darda,</hi> with full reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution (conſidering how Important it was to the preſent Juncture of Affairs) by ſome Stratagem or other, to oblige the Prime <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier</hi> to a Battle. The ſaid Courier reports, that being a League on his way, Early in the Morning, he heard the Diſcharge of a great many Cannon, and continued Vollies of Muſquets; which gave ſubject to believe, that the two Armies began to Engage. The Gentlemen of Horſe of the Marqueſs <hi>Caſtanaga,</hi> Governour of the <hi>Spaniſh-Netherlands,</hi> arriv'd at the ſame time here, being ſent Expreſs to <hi>Don Pedro de Ronquilio</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to him the Glorious Victory the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army has obtain'd over the whole <hi>Ottoman</hi> Force in <hi>Hungary,</hi> being 80000 Effective Fighting men, being brought to <hi>Bruſſels</hi> by the Gentleman of Horſe of the Marqueſs <hi>Burgamanero</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador at <hi>Vienna,</hi> and ſent from his Highneſs the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> by the Prince of <hi>Savoy</hi> to the Emperour, doted from the <hi>Imperial</hi> Army in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Camp near <hi>Eſſeck</hi> the 7th. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1687.

In the Night, the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> caus'd the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> with a conſiderable Body of the Army, to draw out of the <hi>Camp,</hi> ſome one way and others another, as if they were Retreating; which the Prime <hi>Vizier</hi> being adviſed of by his Spies, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (through the diſadvantage they were at the day before,) that the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army was retiring as they did, when they re-paſſed the <hi>Drave,</hi> ſeeing them ſeperated, by Six the next Morning, the Prime <hi>Vizier,</hi> before they were all Retreated, drew out his Army from their Poſt, Attacqu'd the <hi>Chriſtian Camp,</hi> thinking to have eat them for a Breakfaſt; but they Valliantly maintain'd the Fight till al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Noon, before the firſt Detachment (which was March'd ſome Miles round) fell in upon their Rear; and ſoon after, another Body of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> on their Flank, which put them into ſo great a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, ſeeing themſelves Decoy'd, that they began to give ground, taking their Flight towards <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> and ſome Thouſands of them driven into the <hi>Drave;</hi> which, through the rapidneſs of the Stream, were moſt of them Drown'd; but in ſome places the Fight was very Obſtinate and Bloody, and continued till Ten at Night: But in concluſion, the whole Army was Diſcomfited, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> being in a full purſuit after them, they having intirely quitted the Field, leaving all their Cannon, Baggage, and Attirals of War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, which is ſaid to be full as Rich as their <hi>Camp</hi> before <hi>Vienna.</hi> The number of the Slain are Computed to be 8000 on the ſpot, and almoſt as many Drown'd in the River, beſides a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count will be had of the Purſuit, which every Poſt for ſome time will bring us more particularly: The <hi>Germans</hi> in this days Action, have ſo approved themſelves for their Valour and Conduct, as they will for ever be dreadful to the <hi>Turks,</hi> and the Succeſs of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement being the <hi>Turks</hi> laſt Effort, will bring no ſmall Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the Emperour.
